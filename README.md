## About the Video Course
Do you want to be one of the core developers at your company—the person that everyone wants on their team, and who can deliver new features that work on time? Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD) are key disciplines that can help you achieve that goal.

In this video tutorial, you’ll learn about the PyTest testing library and how it’s used to write unit tests in Python. You’ll also set up some common Python development environments to use PyTest. You’ll create isolated test environments with Test Doubles and learn how to implement and use them with unittest.mock. Moving on, you’ll get to know some of the best practices in Unit Testing and TDD and get some hands-on experience with programming by implementing unit tests using TDD in Python. 

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to apply the practices of Unit Testing and TDD on a daily basis to radically increase the quality of your code and help you and your company achieve your goals faster than ever before.
